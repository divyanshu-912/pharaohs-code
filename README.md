## Introduction:
The Pharaoh CAPTCHA Solver is a machine learning-based system designed to recognize and decode text-based CAPTCHAs using TensorFlow (Keras), OpenCV, and Flask. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for character recognition. 
The system includes:
Image Preprocessing â€“ Converts CAPTCHA images to grayscale, applies noise reduction, binarization, and segments individual characters.
CNN Model Training â€“ A deep learning model is trained on CAPTCHA images, normalizing input and using categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification.
CAPTCHA Generation â€“ Uses the ImageCaptcha library to create synthetic training data.
Flask API for Decoding â€“ Provides a REST API to upload CAPTCHA images and return the decoded text in real-time.
The project can be trained locally and deployed as a web service, making it suitable for automating CAPTCHA recognition in various applications.
